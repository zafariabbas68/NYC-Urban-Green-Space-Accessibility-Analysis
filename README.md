# NYC Urban Green Space Accessibility Analysis

![NYC Park Accessibility](nyc_park_analysis_output/nyc_park_accessibility_composite.png)

## Project Overview

A comprehensive geospatial analysis evaluating public park accessibility across New York City using a 0.5-mile walking distance threshold. This project identifies areas with limited park access and provides data-driven recommendations for urban planning interventions.

## Key Findings

- **87.6%** of NYC's area has park access within walking distance
- **12.4%** (37.5 sq miles) lacks adequate park access
- **Manhattan** shows highest accessibility (98.3%)
- **Staten Island** shows lowest accessibility (80.6%)
- **2,054** public parks analyzed totaling **30,488 acres**

Borough-level Analysis

Borough	Area (sq mi)	Accessible Area (sq mi)	Accessibility (%)	Number of Parks	Park Density (parks/sq mi)
Manhattan	22.84	22.45	98.33%	391	17.12
Brooklyn	69.39	63.98	92.20%	614	8.85
Bronx	42.58	37.51	88.07%	391	9.18

Staten Island	58.24	46.93	80.58%	153	2.63
Critical Insights

Strengths

High Overall Accessibility: 87.6% city-wide coverage demonstrates NYC's strong park infrastructure
Manhattan Excellence: Near-universal park access (98.3%) in the most densely populated borough
Substantial Park Inventory: 2,054 parks providing 30,488 acres of green space
Challenges

Geographic Disparities: Staten Island has significantly lower accessibility (80.6%)
Access Gaps: 37.5 square miles without park access within walking distance
Density Variations: Park distribution uneven across boroughs
Recommendations

Immediate Priorities

Targeted Development: Focus on the 12.4% of NYC without park access, particularly in low-accessibility areas
Pocket Parks: Implement small-scale green spaces in high-density, underserved neighborhoods
Pedestrian Infrastructure: Improve walking routes and connectivity to existing parks
Strategic Initiatives

Borough Equity: Prioritize park development in Staten Island and other lower-accessibility areas
Size Diversity: Ensure mix of large destination parks and neighborhood pocket parks
Community Engagement: Involve local residents in park planning and design processes
Long-term Planning

Climate Resilience: Integrate green infrastructure with park development
Health Equity: Align park access with public health objectives
Transit Integration: Coordinate park development with public transportation networks
Applications

This analysis supports:

Urban planning decisions
Park development prioritization
Environmental justice initiatives
Public health planning
Community development programs
Limitations

Walking Distance Assumption: 0.5-mile threshold may not suit all populations
Park Quality: Analysis considers access but not park quality or amenities
Population Distribution: Borough-level data rather than neighborhood-level
Temporal Factors: Analysis represents a snapshot in time
Future Enhancements

Potential improvements include:

Neighborhood-level population data
Park quality and amenity analysis
Seasonal accessibility variations
Public transportation integration
Environmental justice indicators
